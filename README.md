# WP React Plugin Starter

That starter comes with TailwindCSS as well.\

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the plugin in the development mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
